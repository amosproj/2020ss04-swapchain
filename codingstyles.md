# Talking points

## Git workflow
- branching convention
- commit messages
- branch protection
- pre-commit hooks

## Typescript
- YES PLEASE

## Testing
- Testing library
- Test coverage
- Test directory
- is everyone up to date on how to write tests?

## CI
- lint
- test
- build
- dependabot/other
- codacy/other

## CD
- Infrastructure
- GCE, AWS, DO
- Tools (Terraform)

## Code style
- set of eslint rules, can be adjusted later

## Documentation
- inline documentation with annotated functions and classes etc. (This can and should be tested in CI and make sure we do not deliver undocumented code)
    - template for docstrings (can also be enforced by linters)
- real documentation with docusaurus and hosted on github pages
