## Data Security

When it comes to swapping cryptocurrencies via Swapchain, we ensure our users that all counterparty risks are neglected and that no trust is needed. The main reason for that is our atomic cross-chain swap (ACCS) approach.

At Swapchain you are in control of your private keys since they will never leave your browser and are only used to sign your respective transactions. Additionally, we neither save private nor public keys in a database. Hence, you are always in control of your keys, and consequently of your funds.

So, how can you actually conduct an ACCS with Swapchain?
As you know the person you are exchanging BTC/BTS with, the only thing you need to bring is your private key. Just type in the amount you want to send or receive and the rest of the fields before submitting your order. Afterwards, your public Bitcoin key and Bitshares account name can be derived from your private key.

Nothing is saved and you are in charge of your keys throughout the entire transaction.
