## Data Security

When it comes to swapping cryptocurrencies via Swapchain, we ensure that all counterparty risks are avoided and no trust is needed. The main reason is our atomic cross-chain swap (ACCS) approach using Hashed Time Locked Contracts.

At Swapchain you are in control of your private keys since they will never leave your browser and are only used to sign your respective transactions. There is no backend and no database to store anything.

So, how can you actually perform an ACCS with Swapchain?
As you know the person you are exchanging assets with, the only thing you need to bring is your private key. Just type in the amount you want to send or receive and the rest of the fields before submitting your order. Afterwards, your public Bitcoin key and Bitshares account name can be derived from your private key.
